        <p>Chapter 1</p>

        <p>Marlys agreed with Thorne that they needed to call for a council of sorcerers to deal with the threat before someone
            was killed. Gathering her sorcerous strength, Marlys reached out to all the central locations in the continent,
            including the Library of Sorcery.</p>
        <p>“Pardon the interruption,” Marlys said, “but we have a serious incident in Briarhill that requires everyone's
            attention.”</p>
        <p>“A sorcerers’ council?” Lindra, the High Sorcerer at Cloverdell, asked.</p>
        <p>“Yes,” Marlys said. “The town of Riverglen was looted, and by Edwina's account, all indications are that there are
            rogue sorcerers at work.”</p>
        <p>“Rogue sorcerers?” Genevieve, the Head Librarian at the Library of Sorcery, chimed in. “We've had none of those here
            in centuries.”</p>
        <p>Thorne, who had taken a chair to sit next to Marlys, touched Marlys on the sleeve. “May I?”</p>
        <p>Marlys nodded. Thorne had been the High Sorcerer of Goldenvalley before Marlys, and currently had the title of Senior
            Sorcerer of Goldenvalley.</p>
        <p>Thorne addressed Genevieve. “They’re rare here, too. The last incident I dealt with was nearly 40 years ago.”</p>
        <p>“Here in the Library District,” Genevieve said, “we keep a close watch on the towns and villages for those who can
            perform household spells. It would be nearly impossible for any of them to become a sorcerer without our knowledge,
            much less one exercising powers self-taught.”</p>
        <p>“We do our best,” Thorne replied, “but we don’t have adequate numbers to visit every area regularly, and it is
            possible for youngsters bent on secret havoc to hide their powers from us.”</p>
        <p>“Whatever the case,” Marlys said, “it’s a challenge we have to meet, and quickly. Edwina already sent sorcerers from
            her region to investigate. They weren’t able to locate the perpetrators. They remain on alert. We are going to have
            to help scour the region in greater numbers, as soon as possible.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, does that mean we have to postpone my celebration?” Janna, at the Valleyview training center, had just come into
            her powers. Marlys had scheduled the recognition ceremony for the next day.</p>
        <p>Before Marlys could answer, Genevieve said, “Don’t postpone your celebration. I’ll come, and Blair is waving his hand
            volunteering to accompany me. I want to see this.”</p>
        <p>“If you can arrange to transport us to Briarhill,” Niquelle, the High Sorcerer at Silvervale said, “I and some of my
            more experienced sorcerers are willing to join you. But we’re so distant it would take the power of a Librarian to
            take us there.”</p>
        <p>“I’d be happy to do that,” Genevieve said.</p>
        <p>“I can come with sorcerers, too,” Ware, High Sorcerer of Woodlands, added, “again, if a Librarian can take us there.”
        </p>
        <p>Genevieve turned her head. “Blair says he can transport you.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t wish to miss Janna’s celebration,” Thorne said, “but you are going to need me, since all of you are pledged
            to not to harm other sorcerers, and I have an exception for rogues.”</p>
        <p>“There are other ways of handling rogue sorcerers that do not involve harming them,” Genevieve said. “By all means,
            stay for the celebration.”</p>
        <p>“I intend to come at my earliest opportunity, however,” Thorne said.</p>
        <p>“I will, too,” Marlys said.</p>
        <p>“As for me,” Janna said, “I’m willing to postpone my ceremony if it means catching these culprits all the sooner. In
            fact, I’d love to join you and test my powers.”</p>
        <p>“You are far from ready to deal with this,” Thorne said.</p>
        <p>“Maybe,” Janna said, undaunted, “but you at least need someone my age to observe in case there are rogue sorcerers
            after your time that my generation needs to deal with.”</p>
        <p>Marlys held up a hand to forestall an extended argument. “We’ll take this under consideration later. Meanwhile,
            thanks to all those volunteering to help. We’ll see you here tomorrow, Janna.”</p>
        <p>“We will keep you, and everyone else, informed of our progress,” Genevieve said.</p>
        <p>Marlys nodded. “We’d be grateful for that. Thank you, and good evening.”</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>When Marlys entered the training center at Valleyview at the age of sixteen, Janna had been her primary tormentor.
            Because Marlys had suspended her in time, along with all the other sorcerers and apprentices in Goldenvalley in that
            era, for twelve years, Marlys was now thirty, and Janna, nineteen. Since Janna had been released from the time-bind,
            Janna had largely abandoned her bullying ways. Even so, Marlys found her youthful experiences hard to forget. She
            did her best to carry on the tradition of celebrating an apprentice’s awakening of sorcery, but she found there was
            no joy in her heart for arranging this for Janna.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the next morning after breakfast, Marlys stood at the entrance of the Goldenvalley fortress, warmly
            welcoming the region’s sorcerers and apprentices as they arrived. Behind her stood three other Librarians – holding
            that title since their sorcerous powers had been enhanced at the Library of Sorcery: Serena, Tir, and Rochelle, her
            most stalwart allies. Thorne stood to one side at the bottom of the front steps, greeting all the guests. Marlys
            noticed an exceptional warmth to the ones who had served with her when she was High Sorcerer.</p>
        <p>At last, carts from Valleyview began to appear out of distance-shortening spells. Among them was a cart carrying
            Elspeth, who had been Marlys’s sorcerer-trainer, Janna, and Kelsie. Although the same age as Janna, Kelsie’s sorcery
            had not yet awakened. Marlys retained a wariness about Kelsie as well, since Kelsie had eagerly joined Janna in
            earlier abusive behavior toward Marlys, though Kelsie, too, had settled into more moderate ways of late. </p>
        <p>Once an apprentice from the fortress had stepped forward to take the cart, Elspeth, Janna, and Kelsie climbed off. As
            with everyone else at the event, they had dressed in their finest outfits: elegant, embroidered dresses, with silver
            and gold piping, glittering with jewels. Thorne ran forward to meet them, embracing each in turn. They walked to the
            fortress and up the stairs, pausing when they drew even with Marlys.</p>
        <p>Marlys faced Janna with a smile and all the warmth she could muster. Janna had an oval face and short, straight brown
            hair. “Congratulations, Janna, on awakening your sorcery. Make your way to the audience room and I’ll meet you there
            when everyone has arrived.”</p>
        <p>Janna said nothing, but nodded and grinned. She walked inside with Elspeth, Kelsie, and Thorne.</p>
        <p>Tir leaned toward Marlys and spoke in her ear. “At least she’s behaving herself.”</p>
        <p>“Elspeth says she gets into minor mischief at times, but on the whole, takes her responsibility seriously.”</p>
        <p>“In other words, we’re still on guard with her,” Serena said.</p>
        <p>“Naturally,” Marlys said.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Once everyone had gathered in the audience room, Marlys made her way over to Janna. She and Marlys and Thorne, as
            arranged, walked with her to the dais. Janna stood in the center, facing the crowd, with Marlys standing on Janna’s
            left and Thorne standing at Janna’s right.</p>
        <p>Marlys put an arm around Janna’s shoulder and addressed the assembly. “Please join me in welcoming Sorcerer Janna.”
        </p>
        <p>The guests cheered enthusiastically. Tir provided sparkling lights. Others conjured snowflakes, which evaporated
            before reaching the ground. </p>
        <p>Everyone gravitated to the tables of food set out near the walls. The sun shone brightly through the stained glass
            windows and the beams brightened the floor. Tir, Rochelle, and other musicians among the sorcerers struck up a tune.
            Janna led the dances. </p>
        <p>When their energy was spent, all drifted into small groups, conversing. Marlys, as was her obligation, ambled over to
            Janna, surrounded by Kelsie, Elspeth, and Thorne.</p>
        <p>“Your turn next, Kelsie.” Janna took a swig from her cider mug.</p>
        <p>“I will when I’m ready,” Kelsie said with a smile.</p>
        <p>Janna gave Kelsie a playful shove. “You’re never ready.”</p>
        <p>“I’m happy using household spells,” Kelsie said, “and watching the rest of you do your sorcery.”</p>
        <p>Thorne let out a breath. “There was some reason you came to a center of sorcery.”</p>
        <p>Kelsie shrugged. “I had nothing else to do. I didn’t want to get married, and I didn’t want to farm or learn a trade.
            I just wanted to have fun, and I could do household spells.”</p>
        <p>“You’re wasting your talents,” Thorne said.</p>
        <p>“Besides, if you become a sorcerer, we could do sorcery together,” Janna said. “That would be even more fun!”</p>
        <p>Kelsie’s smile never faded. “I’ll think it over.”</p>
        <p>Thorne shook her head sadly.</p>
        <p>“Until you’re ready,” Marlys said to Kelsie, “you’re welcome to remain as an apprentice.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, and you won’t have to go through torture to awaken your sorcery,” Celestine said pointedly, looking
            meaningfully at Thorne. “All Janna had to do was break through a crucible.”</p>
        <p>Marlys had not noticed Celestine’s approach, but could not help but catch the implication. Before Marlys, Throne
            imposed brutal methods to awaken sorcery, thinking this was the only way.</p>
        <p>Thorne stared back at Celestine, but did not take the bait.</p>
        <p>Ignoring her elders, Janna turned back to Kelsie, “Make up your mind soon. Otherwise, you’ll be as old as Marlys
            before you become a sorcerer.”</p>
        <p>“That would not be so bad,” Celestine said kindly. “I’ve heard of sorcerers who waited several years before trying to
            awaken their sorcery.”</p>
        <p>“From what I understand,” Marlys said, “there have been apprentices at the Library of Sorcery who waited until they
            were in their 30s or 40s, though most become sorcerers well before then.”</p>
        <p>“I think that long before that, Kelsie will want to join in,” Elspeth said.</p>
        <p>“Besides,” Kelsie said, “I’ll know all the spells before I become a sorcerer, and not have to learn them after.”</p>
        <p>Thorne chuckled. “There are too many spells for that. We’re all still learning ourselves.”</p>
        <p>“You’ll know a great many of them, though,” Marlys said.</p>
        <p>At that moment, an image of Genevieve appeared in the room. “Marlys, can you join us?”</p>
        <p>The room quieted.</p>
        <p>“Yes, I can join you,” Marlys said. “What have you found?”</p>
        <p>“Nothing, so far,” Genevieve said. “We’ve scoured every part of the towns and countryside around Riverglen and
            there’s no sign of the intruders, whoever they are. Our thought is to bring more sorcerers, spread them out so that
            each sorcerer is within sight of each other, and cover the widest area in case they return.”</p>
        <p>“They will,” Thorne said. “You can count on it.”</p>
        <p>“I was about to ask if you would come, too,” Genevieve said, “since you are the only living sorcerer we know of with
            experience of rogues.”</p>
        <p>“I’m only too glad to help,” Thorne said.</p>
        <p>“Do you have an idea of how many sorcerers you need from Goldenvalley?” Marlys asked.</p>
        <p>“Just bring whoever and how many you believe can join in the task,” Genevieve said.</p>
        <p>“We’ll use the locator spell to find you and be there shortly,” Marlys said.</p>
        <p>“Thank you,” Genevieve said. Her image faded.</p>
        <p>Marlys looked around. “Volunteers? We’ll need to change from our formal clothes quickly.”</p>
        <p>“We have time,” Thorne said. “I doubt they will show themselves until dusk.”</p>
        <p>“We’re willing to help,” Skye said. “But a lot of us don’t know quite what to do.”</p>
        <p>“Then stay here with me,” Celestine said. “They may need us to send supplies or contact other regions for aid.”</p>
        <p>Marlys nodded. “That’s a sound plan.”</p>
        <p>Rochelle started to move toward an exit. “I’m bringing weapons.”</p>
        <p>“You can’t use those on sorcerers,” Thorne said.</p>
        <p>“Weapons have other uses,” Rochelle said, “and they may not all be sorcerers.”</p>
        <p>“Very well,” Thorne conceded.</p>
        <p>“I can’t go,” Nessa said, “I’m still under banishment in the other regions.”</p>
        <p>Zaria took a deep breath. “My banishment was just lifted. Time to test it. Besides, I can attack sorcerers.”</p>
        <p>Janna raised a hand. “I haven’t been pledged yet.”</p>
        <p>“We were getting to that,” Marlys said.</p>
        <p>“You’re too inexperienced, to go, anyway,” Thorne said.</p>
        <p>“Take her,” Elspeth said. “and she’ll get the experience.”</p>
        <p>Thorne threw Marlys a look that Marlys knew showed Thorne remained skeptical, and said, “She should stay here. But I
            agree we should avoid pledging her not to harm other sorcerers until we know what we’re dealing with. We may need
            her in the future.”</p>
        <p>Marlys turned to Janna. “I agree with Thorne that we can wait to pledge you. But I agree with Elspeth that you may go
            for the experience.”</p>
        <p>Janna grinned and rubbed her hands together.</p>
        <p>“But you will stay with either Thorne or me, and your purpose is to observe, not act,” Marlys said.</p>
        <p>Janna responded with a smug smile that told Marlys that Janna intended to disobey at the earliest opportunity. But
            Marlys kept that thought to herself. Janna might still be useful.</p>
        <p>All who wanted to go changed into outdoor gear within minutes. Every fortress kept a store of extra clothes; Janna
            soon found an outfit. The other volunteers were Marlys, Thorne, Serena, Tir, Rochelle, and Zaria. </p>
        <p>Rochelle strode toward Marlys armed with a short sword in a scabbard belted around her waist and a round shield slung
            over her back. She carried a leather jerkin, which she handed to Marlys. “Here, put this on. It’s spelled for extra
            protection.”</p>
        <p>Glancing around, Marlys saw that the other volunteers, save Thorne, had also donned protective clothing: thick
            gloves, caps, vests. </p>
        <p>Thorne had settled for only an outdoor shirt, pants, and boots. “No confidence in your sorcery, I see.”</p>
        <p>“No confidence in our opponents, rather,” Rochelle said.</p>
        <p>Marlys had already cast the locator spell to determine Genevieve’s current location. Now she cast the transportation
            spell. “Ready?”</p>
        <p>The volunteers nodded.</p>
        <p>“May the protection of the Bright Beings go with you,” Celestine called as they exited.</p>
        <p>“Thank you, we’ll need it,” Marlys said as she followed the others.</p>
